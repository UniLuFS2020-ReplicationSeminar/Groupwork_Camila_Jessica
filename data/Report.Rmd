**Introduction**

In this analysis, we will investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of hypertension among participants in the Framingham Heart Study. Obesity, often determined by BMI, is recognized as one of the principal risk factors for hypertension [1]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of hypertension increases with rising BMI [2,3]. Therefore, understanding the relationship between BMI and hypertension prevalence is important for identifying individuals at risk and developing effective prevention and management strategies for hypertension. 

**Methods**

For this study we want it to understand the association between BMI and the prevalence of hypertension on the Framingham Heart Study dataset.
The hypothesis we want to prove is that, as BMI level rises there will be an associated increase in the prevalence of hypertension among the studied population. In order to adress that we utilized logistic regression model.

## R Markdown
```{r}

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
